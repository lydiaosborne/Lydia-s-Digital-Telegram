This project, titled “Digital Aponte” after the influential José Antonio Aponte, provides an interactive experience for users to learn about the artist’s inspirations that contributed to his “book of paintings”. As a free man of color in nineteenth-century Colonial Cuba, Aponte drafted the “book of paintings” depicting black men as leaders through mixed media work. Though the book was never recovered, this project serves as an idea of what the book could look like, the inspirations behind it, as well as the trial records of Aponte describing the book after he was arrested. 

As a whole, the project’s design is visually pleasing and consistent throughout the site. A simplistic menu divides the site into eight main sections. “Aponte’s Library” and the “Book of Paintings” tabs are the most interactive and educational relating to digital humanities.

“Aponte’s Library” gives the user the opportunity to understand the influences behind his “book of paintings”. When the book spines are clicked on, the user is taken into a new tab that explains further about the writings and their contents. The digital bookshelf is the most visually interesting and creative compared to the site’s other pages.

The “Book of Paintings” tab portrays Aponte’s trial transcript where the user is able to click through the “laminas”, or pages, to learn about its subject matter, and read scholarly commentary based on an organized key with a comprehensive layout. When clicked on, the pages have Spanish text with select ones having English commentary. An improvement would be to add an English to Spanish translation option for all pages on the website and vice-versa to increase readability.

The “Image Gallery” displays art that would likely be similar to Aponte’s “book of paintings” which is key to the project’s design. It provides viewers with an idea of what the “book of paintings” might have looked like in reference to the cultural and aesthetic characteristics of Havana in the 1700s and 1800s.

“Aponte’s Havana” is a vintage-looking map with plotted locations that were pertinent to Aponte’s work. Unfortunately, the map is not interactive, though the project creators mention that in the future the plot points will take the user to a page that provides more information on each location. In retrospect, the creators could have waited to publish the page once they had concrete information on the plot points. Currently, the user gains no knowledge from this section except place names that hold no importance because their relevance is not explained.

An instrumental piece of this website is the bibliography page, which lists all of the sources utilized throughout the project, allowing the consumer to critically examine their media. Additionally, there is a site news option on the dropdown menu of the home page, providing a timeline of the website’s updates since 2017, demonstrating how the project has evolved since its launch.

This website is credited by NYU with a project team and an annotation team consisting of mainly history and language professors from mostly American colleges. It serves the educational purpose of offering insight into the prominent artist and antislavery advocate that Aponte was with this digital creation concerning his “book of paintings”. Additionally, as the project creators mention, it marks an inspiring invention that could motivate viewers to think radically about their own designs.
