This project, titled Digital Aponte after the influential artist, provides an interactive experience for users to learn about the inspirations that contributed to his “book of paintings”. As a free man of color in nineteenth-century Colonial Cuba, José Antonio Aponte drafted the “book of paintings” depicting black men as leaders through mixed media work. Black men were not allowed positions like kings or priests during 1700s Cuba, but Aponte visualized a future where they could be. Though the book was never recovered, this project serves as an idea of what the book could look like, the inspirations behind it, as well as the trial records of Aponte describing the book after his arrest. 

Beginning at the home page, there is an explanation of the project and its contents. Following a pragmatic sequence, links to different sections of the site are integrated throughout the summary. This adds an interactive component that keeps the reader engaged while giving them a guide as to what the sections are about. 

In addition to the home page, the project has an entire page that overviews Aponte’s life titled “José Antonio Aponte”. Contextually, this page is necessary to the project because it describes Aponte’s importance as a courageous anti-slavery leader and radical artist. The page also includes visuals like his signature and a map of his artisan workshops. This element is beneficial because it adds interest to a page that would be visually dull if not for the images. Again, there are links throughout the writing, breaking up a lot of heavy information with an interactive component. An improvement would be to add additional images, like of his famous religious statues.

As a whole, the project’s design is visually pleasing and consistent throughout the site. A simplistic menu divides the site into eight main sections. “Aponte’s Library” and the “Book of Paintings” tabs are the most interactive and educational relating to digital humanities.

“Aponte’s Library” gives the user the opportunity to understand the influences behind his “book of paintings”. When the book spines are clicked on, the user is taken into a new tab that explains further about the writings and their contents. The digital bookshelf is the most visually interesting and creative compared to the site’s other pages.

The “Book of Paintings” tab portrays Aponte’s trial transcript where the user can click through the “laminas”, or pages, to learn its contents. The user can also find scholarly commentary based on an organized key. When clicked on, the pages have Spanish text with select ones having English commentary. An improvement would be to add an English to Spanish translation option for all pages on the website and vice-versa to increase readability.

The “Image Gallery” displays art that would likely be similar to Aponte’s “book of paintings” which is key to the project’s design. This is the only aspect of the project that provides a visual idea of Aponte’s art, bringing his creations to life.

“Aponte’s Havana” is a vintage-looking map with plotted locations pertinent to Aponte’s work. Disappointingly, the map is not interactive, and the users gain no context of Havana. In the future, the designers hope to add an interactive element with information on the map’s plot points. In retrospect, the creators could have waited to publish the page once they had the knowledge of the locations’ importance. 

An instrumental piece of this website is the bibliography page, which lists all of the sources utilized throughout the project, allowing the consumer to critically examine their media. Additionally, there is a site news option on the dropdown menu of the home page, providing a timeline of the website’s updates since 2017, demonstrating how the project has evolved since its launch.

This website is credited by NYU with a project team and an annotation team consisting of mainly history and language professors from mostly American colleges. It serves the educational purpose of offering insight into the prominent artist and antislavery advocate that Aponte was with this digital creation concerning his “book of paintings”. Additionally, as the project creators mention, it marks an inspiring invention that could motivate viewers to think radically about their own designs.
