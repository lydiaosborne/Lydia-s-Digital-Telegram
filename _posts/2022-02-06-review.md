This project, titled Digital Aponte after the influential José Antonio Aponte, provides an interactive experience for users to learn about the artist’s inspirations that contributed to his most famous creation being the “book of paintings”. In colonial Cuba, Aponte was a free man of color who is thought to be a major figure behind the antislavery movement in the early 1800s (cite).  Considering the context of the time the “book of paintings” symbolizes the dreams of what life would be like for a free man of color with depictions of black men serving in positions like emperors or priests, which was unheard of for Cuba in the nineteenth century (cite). Though the book was never recovered, this project serves as an idea of what the book could look like, the inspirations behind it, as well as the trial records of Aponte describing the book after he was arrested. 

As a whole, the project’s design is visually pleasing and consistent throughout the site. A simplistic menu divides the site into eight main sections, with “Aponte’s Library” and the “Book of Paintings” tabs being the most interactive and educational relating to digital humanities.

“Aponte’s Library” gives the user the opportunity to understand the influences behind his “book of paintings”. When the book spines are clicked on, the user is taken into a new tab that explains further about the writings and its contents. The digital bookshelf is the most visually interesting and creative compared to the site’s other pages.

The “Book of Paintings” tab portrays Aponte’s trial transcript where the user is able to click through the “laminas”, or pages, to learn about its subject matter, and read scholarly commentary based on an organized key with a pragmatic, comprehensive layout. When clicked on, the pages have Spanish text with select ones having English commentary. It could be improved if there was an English to Spanish translation option for all pages on the website and vice-versa to increase readability. 

The “Image Gallery” takes the user through visualizations that would likely be similar to Aponte’s “book of paintings”, describing the art of the time. This section is key to the project’s design. Conceptualizing what this mixed media creation looks like without having actual scanned pages of the document is impossible without their visual examples. It provides viewers with an idea of what the “book of paintings” might have looked like in reference to the cultural and aesthetic characteristics of Havana in the 1700s and 1800s. 

“Aponte’s Havana” is a vintage-looking map with plotted locations that were pertinent to Aponte’s work. Unfortunately, the map is not interactive, though the project creators mention that in the future the plot points will take the user to a page that provides more information on the location. In retrospect, the creators could have waited to publish the page once they had concrete information on the locations because currently, it seems an unnecessary addition to the site’s experience. 
An instrumental piece of this website is the bibliography page, which lists all of the sources utilized throughout the project, allowing the consumer to critically examine their media. Additionally, there is a site news option on the dropdown menu of the home page, providing a timeline of the website’s updates since 2017, demonstrating how the project has evolved since its launch.

This website is credited by NYU with a project team and an annotation team consisting of mainly history and language professors from mostly American colleges. It serves the educational purpose of offering insight into the prominent artist and antislavery advocate that Aponte was with this digital creation concerning his “book of paintings”.
