When first assigned to read Stoker’s _Dracula’s Guest_, I had limited understanding as to how a spooky story on vampires and werewolves related to digital humanities. The story itself was entertaining, but I was confused as to how the texts could be used in code. Yet after meeting with Dr. Stover and discussing digital encodings and their connection to TEI, my interest peaked. 

Understanding that digital humanities utilize tools like TEI to educate users on classic texts in an interactive way caused me to be excited about using the program Oxygen. As alluded to in my tweets below, anything computer-science related has always been intimidating. However, this beginners project makes me excited to take the DH minor’s required computer-science courses in the future.

Before beginning the coding process, I labeled aspects of the _Dracula’s Guest_ text I was assigned through Google Drive’s commenting feature. Having pieces of the text highlighted in yellow with indicators like “quote”, “paragraph”, or “em-dash” was beneficial in actually starting the TEI coding process. It allowed me to clearly view a layout of where tags needed to be once I actually pasted the text into Oxygen XML Editor. This part of the process was essential and definitely something I would do in future digital encodings because it kept me organized when I could have easily forgotten where a page began or a paragraph started.

After labeling the text with tags in Google Drive, I was able to begin coding. When I first opened the blank document, I was overwhelmed. There was colored text with random words and attributes that had no known meaning to me. The way the tags were spaced seemed specific and I had no understanding as to why that mattered; it all felt very foreign to me. Yet after I followed Dr. Stover’s clear instructions, the process ran a lot smoother than anticipated. To me, it felt like completing a pattern or playing a matching game. All I had to do was make sure I was consistent with my opening and ending tags and that I added the elements where I was supposed to.

The only issue I had was when I added a page beginning attribute. For some reason to which I am still unsure, the program was not validating the page number, saying I had used the quotations incorrectly. After retyping the code, a little green square appeared symbolizing all was well. It was frustrating at first because I was unsure of what the problem was, which had me at a loss for a solution. However, it definitely made me determined to keep trying, and when the text finally showed up correctly in the author’s view, it was rewarding. This assignment eased my fears with code and make me interested in attempting more TEI projects in the future.
